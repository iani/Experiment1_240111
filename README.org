This is a file to familiarize myself with:

- creating and merging branches 
    - resolving conflicts when merging branches
- checking out branches or commits 
- reverting 
- selective merging of parts of code from another branch to the current branch.

The history of this repository is messy and the contents are just dummy texts.
