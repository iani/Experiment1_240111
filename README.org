This is an org file.

* But there is no org mode in vs-code?
** There is org mode support 

Here I edit in order to commit my second commit...
And some more stuff to understand how vs code is working.

Here I will branch and commit and see if the branch grows. 

And I continue to add more stuff.

And even more. The branch should grow dammit. 

And some more stuff even.

And this should be the third commit.

And this the fourth commit. 

Fifth commit.  Maybe. 

Trying to edit. This is strange.

I have merged this file and now here I add more stuff.

And now moving forward. The main branch should emerge on top.
